# Python_To_Binary
A way to convert files to binary with python and vice versa.

This is way to covert any ascii data into a binary format that would be extremely hard to understand, it can also convert the outputted file back into a readable ascii format.

For converting any data from any readable format please use the Transpiler to convert back to readable, and for python scripts that dont require them to be fully transpiled/are not extra libraries use the interpreter.

The binary file does not require the original file to exist to run or convert but will require any libraries used to be present or converted before running the interpreter
