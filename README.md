# Python_To_Binary
A way to convert files to binary with python and vice versa.

This is way to covert any ascii data into a binary format that would be extremely hard to understand, it can also convert the outputted file back into a readable ascii format.

For converting any data from any readable format please use the Transpiler to convert back to readable, and for basic python scripts that dont require any number based input plese use the translator as it will run the code straight away.
